# You will need a developer app registered with apps.twitter.com
# These values are all accessible from there. The first two are generated
# when the app is created. Then a separate step to create an access token
# generates the last two
#
# Fill in those values and rename this file as credentials.yml
# so it will be picked up during bootup
#
# note: the leading colon is required for symbol keys
